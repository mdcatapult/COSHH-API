• To produce a world-leading optical approach for cancer diagnosis.
• SMi is currently developing its approach for infectious disease. This cancer study will provide validation that in principle SMi’s devices can be used for a broader range of other diagnostic applications.
• To enable the MDC and SMi to continue their valued established relationships by working on an important area of diagnostic need.
• SMi will benefit from continued access to the MDC’s wet lab capabilities and the experience of its scientists. This could be particularly valuable if the team of scientists that are currently working on SMi’s COVID-19 project can be retained.
• MDC will benefit from continued access to SMi’s single molecule expertise, and the stream of innovations developed over the course of pre-commercial development.
• It is anticipated that results from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals.","Client is a UK company that has developed a novel device and accompanying disposable diagnostic chips that utilise super-resolution imaging to directly determine affinities of single molecule interactions.

Assuming success and to ensure the appropriate acceleration of the programme, our bid also includes vital planning and preliminary activities to support GLP toxicology, manufacturing and cell line development scale up and Clinical Development strategy. The greatest innovation will be developing a disease-modifying therapeutic for this devastating disease and we believe that with Innovate UK funding, we will be well positioned to achieve this.","Huntington's Disease (HD) is a devastating inherited condition that leads to movement, cognitive and psychiatric disorders ultimately leading to progressive loss of function and death. Symptoms occur at any time but often appear at 35-44years. The time from disease emergence to death is 10-30 years. There is currently no cure and no therapies able to slow the disease, only treatments to help manage the symptoms. Our vision is to develop a first-in-class disease-modifying therapy and bring it to patients as quickly as possible. Using a radical new approach, we have already completed the first step in this effort, identifying lead antibodies from individuals demonstrating resilience in neurodegenerative disease. Starting from 'at risk' individuals with unexpected resilience in disease gives us additional translatable target validation from the outset. "

With this comes an exciting opportunity to build and deliver biomarker clinical trial exploratory analysis to build key hypothesis data to support an influence future clinical trial design.

As such MDC have a requirement to increase the rigor of certain aspects of lab delivery, from a GLS (General lab standard) of which we currently run our research programs, to the principles to GCLP (Good Clinical Laboratory Practice) to ensure all procedures are put in place to deliver such decision-making data.
","Framework processes to be scoped and implemented - 
-Laboratory
-Equipment, maintenance, calibration
-Full traceability and maintenance of equipment and materials
-Contamination control
-Analytical plan template
-Review of laboratory calculations / workflow steps (where appropriate)
-Sample management (based on current MDC processes)
-Facilities, environmental control
-Data collection, processing, storage and transfer
-Review, improvement and preparation of new SOPs

Non-laboratory
-People, responsibilities, training records, signature log
-quality control and quality assurance processes
-Deviation protocols (e.g. What went wrong / effect on study / mitigation etc)

This has recently been posed by Kirsty Wynn of VR&D. Or, I have a protein, what compounds could be active against it (MDCP-0293)? Both Emily Offer and Lorna Fitzpatrick have asked this question of informatics recently as well. The Ares project was created to add the internal capability to answer such questions. However, the current set of algorithms and protocols are manually intensive. A further consideration in implementing such a capability is that partners can be sensitive about how many people know the identity of their asset, so we are interested in investigating Ares as a service that would require minimal manual input by the Informatics team. To this end, we are proposing a capability build project that will investigate how Ares can be turned into a service, what that service might look like and, using various use-cases.","There are five components to the Virtual Screening Pipeline:

Although great progress has been made in the treatment of some common cancers there remain many indications where there has been little improvement over decades. One of these is aggressive brain tumours, such as glioblastoma, which have a median survival time of 14.6 months -- a figure that has not improved over the last four decades.
The current best supported care is surgery, which removes as much of the tumour as possible, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Cancer invariably recurs in the region of the resection cavity and progresses rapidly.
A unique nanoparticle loaded hydrogel will be developed which will release nanoparticles in areas of residual cancer. The gel will use the acidic cancer microenvironment to release radiotherapy enhancing nanoparticles using pH as a trigger. MDC will develop a novel mouse model that will involve resecting an orthotopic fluorescent tumour, treating the resultant cavity and an advanced small animal radiotherapy platform to provide fractionated radiotherapy to the tumour area. This novel model will provide a more representative clinical model. MDC's advanced imaging capability will then study tumour regrowth with and without hydrogel to demonstrate product efficacy.
The data will form the basis of a submission to MHRA that will enable client to take the product forward to clinical trials. Given the critical clinical need for new treatments for this devastating disease, client expects the roll-out to be rapid.","Opportunity
•	Glioblastoma usually comes back and brain tumour success rates are low.

AIMS:
· Generate 3D multicellular cardiac models for robust and reliable drug screening.
· To recapitulate differential cardiotoxic effects of gender and diverse ethnicities.
· Enable more predictive cardiac drug discovery and development.

OVERVIEW:
· Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United Kingdom and United States, and risk of heart disease death differs by race and ethnicity.
· The main cause of safety related drug attrition is cardiotoxicity.
· Lack of effective models and tests to predict and treat cardiac damage and understand disparities between race and gender.
· Current in vitro models are limited in supply, function, and maturity.
· Cadaveric tissue is a highly variable due to its source. When multiple extractions are combined, the combined genetic complexity can generate ambiguous and unreliable results.
· Current stem cell derived models are 2D – lacking physiological mechanical and biological cues, or are lacking maturity, therefore do not accurately reflect adult organ function.
· 75% of drugs fail due to lack of testing in distinct genetic backgrounds.
· 3D multicellular models from a variety of genetic background will enable drug developers to back the safest drugs and ensure clinical success.

Though these data resources are freely available to the research community they have become an asset for the organisations that maintain them. Besides increasing visibility, they attract grant funding, collaborations, and the provision of services.

MDC now has the capability to generate whole transcriptome analysis and tailored proteomic analysis within cells and tissues with spatial complexity.

MDC is a unique position to create the Digital Spatial Profiler Atlas, a word leading data resource complementary and as impactful as data resources like HPA and EA. The Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) technology iii is a novel technology and MDC is one of the main experts using it and analysing its data.

The DSP Atlas will not just host the DSP data but will also provide automated analytic capabilities and visualisations to facilitate the interpretation of the data.

The following deliverables will be produced: 
· Peer reviewed publication of the CF infection TPPs, with input from international stakeholders including people with CF, clinicians, industry, funders (CF Trust, CF Foundation, MRC, Carb-X) and regulators.
· Setup of a 3 year programme grant on which MDC will be represented via the expert advisory group – the output of the grant will be a website containing protocols and tools to support researchers in CF antimicrobial development (pending funding decision).
 · A protocol for a new ASM media, validated to industry to standard, and widely available to the community –opportunities will be explored for MDC infection facility to collaborate on this project and provide ASM testing as a service.
 · Alignment of the MDC CF AMR Biorepository project (MDCP-0247) to the CF Syndicate in AMR.","People with cystic fibrosis (CF) die from antibiotic failures, so the development of new antimicrobial treatments to treat infections associated with CF is an urgent unmet need. Whilst there is some global activity in the space globally, key challenges in CF antimicrobial development remain.
The CF Syndicate in Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) was launched in September 2019 to overcome the challenges in CF antimicrobial discovery and development. The Syndicate successfully galvanised the CF research community to bring together leaders from academia, industry and the clinic, along with people with CF. The Syndicate has engaged widely within the sector and started to build impactful programmes of work to tackle the challenges in CF antimicrobial development. This has led to: 
· The development of CF infection Target Product Profiles (TPPs), which aim to be finalised in May 2021.
· The submission of a CF Trust Strategic Research Centre (SRC) £750k grant to map the CF preclinical screening and testing pathway – funding decision expected in May 2021.
· Funding to MDC to setup a CF AMR Biorepository (MDCP-0247).
· Commitment from a UK SME, Novabiotics, to fund a collaborative programme to develop and validate a new artificial sputum media (ASM) and make the protocol available widely to support CF antimicrobial efficacy testing – project to be set up in Q1 2021/22 Great progress has been made over the past 18 months, but there is still scope to build on the achievements to date to position the CF Syndicate in AMR as a focal global platform to bring together the research community and to drive more impactful CF antimicrobial R&D projects.

Summary of Proposal:
Funded by a grant from the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, this project will deliver the implementation of the CF Syndicate in AMR’s new strategy for 2021, which will involve:
· Continuing to build the toolkit of enabling resources to support CF antimicrobial development e.g. finalise and disseminate the CF infection TPPs, support the setup and delivery of the SRC grant to map the CF preclinical pathway (if funded), support the delivery of an SME-led programme to develop a novel ASM
· Creating a unique cross-sector CF AMR network to bring the CF research community together, facilitate collaboration and promote knowledge exchange.
· Identify and support promising CF antimicrobial programmes, exploiting the CF Syndicate in AMR enabling resources and network, and aligning projects to novel funding mechanisms."

The client has a project where they are looking at micronuclei (MN) as an endpoint. They have dose response data in vitro but are looking to move this into animal and ultimately clinical studies. Obviously 
this isn’t as easy in tissue as it is in cell culture, especially given that they wish to becin a position to do some quantitation. They are working with Oracle Bio about ways in which this could be analysed. The concensus of opinion is that conventional H&E may not be the best stain to use to identify the MN and alternative DNA stains should be considered.

· Stage 1: Cell lines – Artios have 4 cell lines that they will treat to induce MN formation, plus vehicle controls, to give 8 cell line samples. MDC will:
o Produce FFPE cell blocks.
o Stain sections NAH Feulgen & traditional Feulgen (well-characterised histochemical methods for the demonstration of DNA).
o Stained sections scanned at 40x magnification
o Images transferred to Oracle Bio for development of an image analysis package.

Stage 2 will be initiated only if this stage is successful, i.e. that Feulgen plus image analysis can detect MN and differentiate degrees of MN formation.

· What is the unmet need or opportunity/problem to be solved?
-Development of histopathology methodology to assist with the analysis of micronuclei. The costed project is for the first stage using cell lines. A second stage using tumour xenografts, and a third using human tissue have been discussed should this first stage be successful.","The stained slides will be imaged and the data send to Artios Pharma’s other partner Oracle Bio (a CRO in our CRO Network) for further image analysis.
· Is there anything that is out of scope?
-It is the intention that this project turns into a larger collaboration and a second and third stage as well as an additional workpackage involving peripheral blood smears have been discussed but are currently out of scope for the delivery of this costed project.

· Stage 2: Tumour xenografts – The final numbers will be determined by the data generated in Stage 1, but the initial plan is:
o Up to 32 samples across 3 studies
o N= 5-6 per treatment group
o Vehicle vs test compound

MDC will process the tissues to FFPE, cut sections, stain with Feulgen and scan the stained slides for analysis by Oracle Bio. Success in xenograft sections is necessary before progression to Stage 3. (Resource – KR 4-5 days) 

· Stage 3: Human tissues?
– Tbd. MDC to help with access to relevant tissues. There may also be subsequent WPs looking at demonstration of MN in peripheral blood smears."

Evox has developed an unparalleled proprietary technology platform, DeliverEXTM, to enable it to modify exosomes, to load drugs into exosomes, and to target the delivery of these exosomes to organs of interest. Evox has successfully demonstrated this capability by delivering drug-loaded exosomes into 
target organs including the central nervous system and other intractable tissues. Exosome-based drugs have the potential to address some of the limitations of protein, antibody, and nucleic acid-based therapies by enabling delivery to cells and tissues that are currently out of reach using other drug delivery technologies. Evox is leading the development within this emerging space and the company is poised to break new ground in the treatment of severe rare genetic disorders using its innovative 
exosome therapeutics.

Evox Therapeutics (Sally Price) has approached us and they have a need for a series of biodistribution studies. The first study required is a parallel based approach assessing both a Luc-encoded Exosomal IVIS imaging study and an 89Zr labelled exosome study. Protocols are available and in place for both the labelling and Luc encoding.

We will be perforing an oxine 89Zr labelled approach in a FFS study in the coming weeks and we have radiochemistry expertise in this protocol.

The project aims to build and strengthen access to high quality clinically relevant samples, data and expertise to enable researchers from academia and industry to identify and translate discoveries into new treatments for infections in people with cystic fibrosis. ","This project will bring together a group of university, hospital and public health laboratories, from across the UK with clinical samples, data and expert knowledge needed by medicines developers, and link them with a coordinating centre that has expertise in both looking after clinical samples and communicating with researchers developing medicines. MDC, as the coordinating centre will work with all the groups in the network along with researchers looking to access samples and the regulatory bodies that approve medicines to develop sample catalogues, processes and infrastructure that will make it quick and easy for researchers developing new medicines to access the samples, data and expertise they need so that new medicines can reach people with CF faster. Importantly, people with CF will be able to engage with the programme and become directly involved by donating their sputum samples and receiving updates on the impact this is having in the development of new medicines to treat lung infections in people with CF.

Trastuzumab (Trz) a monoclonal antibody to 
HER-2, arises significant clinical benefits in Breast and Stomach cancer treatments. However, some 
patients become resistance to Trz treatment within ~6 months despite that tumour growth continues to be dependent on HER2 signalling. Therefore, the development of novel HER2-targeted agents is crucial for the improvement of the current breast cancer treatments. 

As a complementary treatment to Trz, the partner have generated a HER2 affibody-apoferritin  fusion (HER2-Afb-Apo). An affibody(Afb) is a small peptide that functions in a very similarly to Trz, binds tightly to a different extracellular part of the HER2 receptor. Apoferritin(Apo) is a human protein made up of 24 identical subunits that self-assembles into a 12 nm diameter protein nanoparticle. They have fused a HER2-Afb to the N-terminus of each apoferritin subunit and this allows us to create nanoparticles that have 24 HER2-Afb. These can bind ≤24 HER2 receptors simultaneously (Trz can only bind ≤2 HER2 per antibody). The HER2-Afb-Apo prevents HER2-EGFR heterodimerization, switching off the pathway for cell division and therefore stops proliferation. HER2-Afb-Apo rapidly clears the HER2 receptors from the cell surface and promotes their degradation; Trz causes transient internalization of the HER2 receptor, which then recycles to the cell surface.

The most difficult tumours tend to be inoperable with treatment options limited to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Chemotherapy is administered systemically and a balance between toxicity and tumour dose is hard to achieve. Radiotherapy is more effective as it can be targeted on the tumour. However, it relies on the presence of oxygen to generate cell killing free radicals, meaning that aggressive oxygen deficient (hypoxic) tumours cannot be treated without unacceptable off target toxicity.
Recently, nanoparticles have begun to be used as radiosensitisers to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy treatment. Partner 1 has developed a technology, based on titanium oxide, which generates free radicals under radiotherapy by water splitting; thus, circumventing the hypoxia. In order to escape rapid immune system clearance nanoparticle radiosensitisers are more effectively injected directly into the tumour.

Direct intratumoural injection is currently under active investigation as a method of reducing systemic toxicity but presents a twofold challenge for clinicians. Firstly, direct real-time imaging of the needle tip into the tumour is difficult, particularly for deep tumours in, for example, the pancreas. Secondly, it is not known how far from the needle tip the active ingredient disperses into the tumour. Consequently, it is very difficult for the clinician to devise an effective clinical intervention strategy for intratumoural injection. This project will address this issue using a combination of radiosensitising nanoparticles, ultrasound driven injection and advanced imaging facilities.

Partner 2 have a unique platform technology whereby ultrasonic vibrations are applied to needles during injection. This allows both improved imaging during injections critical for deep tumours in the pancreas, and for enhanced distribution of nanoparticles from the needle tip. Both partners have been working together for over two years and have demonstrated enhanced distribution.","The project will use ultrasound to demonstrate real time imaging of the nanoparticles during injection and, from this, develop the basis of a clinical intervention strategy for cancer treatment using intratumoural njection"

As such, siRNAs have the potential to provide effective treatment options for diverse diseases including cancer. The first regulatory approvals of Alnylams siRNA therapies for liver disorders in 2018-19 [1-2] have validated the clinical and commercial opportunity for such therapies. However, the major limiting factor for their further success remains the lack of effective systems for systemic delivery of siRNAs to specific diseased cells [4]. Current approaches, primarily GalNAc-conjugates, lipid nanoparticles and viral vectors, are suboptimal given their limited cell targeting specificity, cargo loading capacity, high toxicity, and complex/expensive manufacturing that limit the type of addressable disease indications. PODS can address this drug delivery challenge given their modular design based on a central RNA nanoscaffold, which can be functionalised with therapeutics and targeting molecules that recognise biomarkers on cancer -but not healthy- cells. Although first-generation PODS demonstrated promising invitro and in vivo results, with highly competitive safety and favourable cost profiles, the efficacy remains to be optimised.

MDCP-0196,Lee,Discovery,Completed,,,Martin Main,Gerrit Daubner,Paul Bryce,1 - Core,Target Engagement & Pathways,,,"The Simoa® technology is a method for measuring protein analytes that is orders of magnitude more sensitive than corresponding conventional ELISAs. This is achieved by using arrays of femtoliter-sized reaction chambers that can isolate and detect a single molecule of the target protein. Multiplexing allows to detect up to 6 proteins in one assay. 
We aim to integrate the Simoa® in our Pathways platform to detect ultra-low amounts of total and phosphorylated protein. This is useful when sample quantity is critical (e.g. primary cells, organoids) or when target abundance is low. We will explore the technical boundaries of this technology aiming to decrease costs and increase its accessibility. We will also attempt to re-purpose the Simoa® technology with the Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA®), which would constitute a novel and unique way to study signalling pathways in primary  and complex cells. Besides offering this technology as fee-for-service, there is also the opportunity to publish our results in a peer-reviewed journal.

The HiBiT technology is based on the complementation between 1.3 kDa peptide HiBiT and its 18 kDa subunit LgBiT to produce a bright and quantitative luminescence signal. It was recently shown that HiBiT can be readily linked to endogenous genes using genome editing allowing sensitive quantitation of the response dynamics of proteins and their post-translational modifications (Schwinn et al, ACS Chem Biol, 2020). This provides a simple mix and read format for 384 well plate-based applications.
We aim to integrate this workflow in our Pathways platform to study signalling events using generic reagents by minimizing the need of specific antibodies. ","Post-translational modifications (PTM) like phosphorylation are a key regulatory mechanism to transduce a stimulus into a biochemical signal. Activation of signalling pathways subsequently lead to a multitude of cellular responses including enzyme activity modulation, gene expression and protein degradation. Slight disruptions of those intricate biological networks can cause pathologies such as cancer or neurodegeneration and studying them is key to understanding the causes of disease, measuring biomarkers and finding suitable treatments.

We aim to establish a platform to analyse signalling pathways by measuring changes in total protein and phosphorylation levels. Our Pathways platform will set itself apart from other offerings by being versatile and affordable. This will allow us to offer this platform to a wide range of customers having a variety of budgets and needs. Recognizing that our goal cannot be achieved as a one-fits-all solution, our Pathways platform will be built upon different technologies that can be either used separately or interconnected.
